Built with:
* React
* TypeScript
* Firebase
* CSS
* Styled Components

<strong>Learning Process:</strong>
1. This app was a quick build and arguably the first one that I felt 100% comfortable completing. I had little to no blockers, was able to integrate a backend for multiple data sources to use on the front end, and was able to make it computer and mobile friendly.

2. TypeScript is a lot more solidified than it was. With the heavy amount of props and integration this app required, I saw the true power of TypeScript and it's interfaces/Types when sending props. Every time I was sending data, functions, etc to another component in React I was very aware of what I was sending and what it was thanks to TypeScript. I don't think I'd go back to plain JavaScript if I had a choice after building this project.

3. I drew out every single component by hand and took notes on what I wanted each thing to do, before I started building this app; I strongly believe I cut out at least 10 hours of coding by doing so. And it will be a practice that I continue moving forward.

4. This app took about 2~ weeks start to finish, working about 1-3 hours a day, and taking a day off here and there.

<strong>Notes for Improvement:</strong>
1. Looking back, I would of taken the imgs for the levels, and the data for each level and compiled them into one source on the backend with firebase. I think the front end would've been built a little cleaner had then been done from the get-go.

2. I wanted to try out Styled Components in one of the parts of the app, as I heard they are very nice to use in larger applications. I tested it out in a use case that isn't the best for styled components. So, looking back and thinking about future projects I think I'm going to outline what components are going to be re-used and pre-determining what needs to be a Styled Component, so I can utilize that feature more. I do see how it can save a lot of time when building apps.
